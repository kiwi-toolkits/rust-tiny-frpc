# Tags the current commit as vX.Y.Z, pushes the tag, and dispatches the release
# workflow *at that tag* rather than relying on the push to trigger it. The
# direct push is the reliable path here: a plain `git push` over a flaky proxy
# can drop the connection after the objects land but before the ref does, and a
# tag push that arrives without a matching workflow trigger leaves a tag with no
# release behind it.

# Needs the `gh` CLI, authenticated with permission to write to the repository.
